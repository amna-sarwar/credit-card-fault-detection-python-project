# credit-card-fault-detection-python-project
This project aims to build an efficient credit card fraud detection system using various machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on addressing the challenge of detecting fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset, where fraudulent transactions make up a very small percentage of the total transactions.
